## TruSat Learn

### What is this?

This is the documentation for the [TruSat](https://trusat.org) project and it was bootstrapped with a fork of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

The [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) app deployed at [https://learn.trusat.org](https://learn.trusat.org) can be found in the `/website` directory.

The [README](https://github.com/trusat/trusat-learn/tree/master/website) for the `/website` directory has some further advice on how to navigate this repository and contribute changes/additions to the content.

### Get Started

You can clone the repo, install all the dependencies and run the app in development mode with the following commands in your Terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/trusat/trusat-learn.git trusat-learn
cd trusat-learn/website && yarn install && yarn start
```

This should open http://localhost:3000 in your default browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### Governance
