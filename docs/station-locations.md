## Why do I need to create a station to submit observations?
For a satellite observation to be incorporated into an orbit determination, it needs to include the coordinates for the location from which the observation was made. We understand most people aren’t keen to share the coordinates of their backyard with the world. To build a transparent record of satellite behavior, while allowing people to maintain their privacy and contribute anonymously, TruSat uses a four-character station ID in place of your coordinates. This format extends the standard set by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR).

When you submit an observation, you’ll be asked to include your location. TruSat will publish your observations in your profile, but keep your location privately encrypted.
