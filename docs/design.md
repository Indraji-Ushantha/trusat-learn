## Contributing to TruSat's design
TruSat community members are free to contribute to TruSat's strategy and design. Common cases might include proposing UX concepts or UI specifications. 

You may use your design tool of choice. TruSat’s initial designs were made via the free tier of Figma, a browser-based design tool.

Updates to TruSat’s design follow the same basic procedure as that of any other update to TruSat.

To propose a design update:
- Create a new issue in [TruSat's frontend repo](https://github.com/consensys-space/trusat-frontend) 
- Describe the problem that the design addresses, and how the design solves the problem.
- Attach images of the design. When practical, also include a link to the original design file. 
- Add the tag “design” to the issue, along with any other pertinent tags.
- After publishing the issue, please add your design to the list of designs below, so that fellow design contributors can see all TruSat designs in one place.
