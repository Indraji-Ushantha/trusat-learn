## VIII. ConsenSys’ Business Interest in TruSat

ConsenSys Space, which developed the free, open source software powering TruSat, is wholly-owned by ConsenSys, Inc., a privately-held blockchain technology company. As the TruSat.org domain signifies, TruSat is designed to generate a global public good rather than profit. ConsenSys’ business interests underpinning its investments in TruSat and other pioneering space applications of Ethereum blockchain technology merit a brief explanation.

ConsenSys has broad business interests in developing and growing the Ethereum ecosystem. Pioneering applications of Ethereum that illuminate entirely new solution spaces for old, stubborn problems benefit the ecosystem. ConsenSys believes that enabling large-scale, global collective action is among the most transformative potential applications of Ethereum blockchain technology, and is investing in solving space-related collective action challenges as R&D to accelerate the realization of this potential. Space is hard, and that’s the point. The challenges of the original moonshot were undertaken “...not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills...” Realizing ConsenSys Space’s vision for Earth’s Space Program will require a global, open source moonshot, galvanizing developer communities, and drawing a diverse swath of Earth’s population—and with them, new perspectives and ideas—into the Ethereum ecosystem. Building the infrastructure to enable all people to contribute and participate directly in space endeavors will necessarily yield innovations that empower a wider range of people across our planet to utilize Ethereum technology, and to develop new, transformative applications of it.

Taking a long view, the potential applications blockchain technology in space exploration and commerce are vast. The legal and physical attributes of space—the only domain of human activity not ordered around territorial sovereignty, in which a diverse range of actors from a growing number of countries must coordinate and transact—presents governance challenges to which Ethereum smart contract functionality supplies natural solutions. ConsenSys’ present space R&D therefore represents long-term investments in developing Ethereum’s full potential, on Earth and beyond.
