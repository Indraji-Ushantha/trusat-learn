Just like the [code](https://github.com/trusat) that underpins TruSat; this [documentation](https://github.com/trusat/trusat-learn) is also open-source!

If you want to edit any of the content please use the `EDIT` button to the top-right of any page you are viewing. This will bring you directly to where that specific page is hosted on [Github](https://github.com). If you don't already have a Github account you will need to create one.

### Markdown

All of the pages of the TruSat documentation are written with Markdown - a lightweight `markup` language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. If you having never written anything using Markdown before then this [Basic Syntax Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) will very quickly help you get up to speed.

### Using Github

1. Once you've selected a page to edit and have clicked te `Edit` button located on the top-right of the page, you will be brought to where that file is hosted. To edit the file click on the pencil icon. This will allow you to begin editing the file.

2. Now you can begin to update the documentation. Pay attention to the formating of the current documentation while you are making your edits.

3. Once you have finished updating the documenation, look for the section labeled `Commit changes` towards the bottom of your screen. Here you can add a label and description to explain what changes you have made to the documentation. Fill out this section then click Commit changes to complete your edit.

4. You will then be taken to a page where you can confirm the changes you have made by starting a pull request. This step allows your updated documentation to be visible to fellow contributors so they can discuss and review the changes you have submitted. After this step is complete, your documenation can then be merged and added to Learn.TruSat.org.
