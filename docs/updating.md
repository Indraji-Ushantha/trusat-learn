Just like the [code](https://github.com/consensys-space) that underpins TruSat; this [documentation](https://github.com/consensys-space/trusat-learn) is also open-source!

If you want to edit any of the content please use the `EDIT` button to the top-right of any page you are viewing. This will bring you directly to where that specific page is hosted on [Github](https://github.com). If you don't already have a Github account you will need to create one.

### Markdown

All of the pages of the TruSat documentation are written with Markdown - a lightweight `markup` language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. If you having never written anything using Markdown before then this [Basic Syntax Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) will very quickly help you get up to speed.
