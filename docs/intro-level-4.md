Once you have timed a satellite, the final step is to input your time and location data into software that will calculate an initial orbit determination (IOD).

At this time, translating basic observation data (time and location) into a format readable by version 0.1 TruSat Prototype requires a relatively advanced workflow, including use of free third-party software, and is not recommended for all but the most committed.
