In its initial prototype releases, TruSat will implemented three features of blockchain functionality.

- **A.** User identity via wallet-based login, and the associated Web3 onboarding opportunity.
- **B.** Registering of “authenticated” versions of code and algorithm base in the runtime code.
- **C.** Periodic consistency checking of tamper evidence by comparing with blockchain checkpoints for code-base and data-base.

After implementing these basic features, and demonstrating the broader utility and value of the [Proof of Satellite](proof-of-sat) engine, a transition to Ethereum mainnet will enable more advanced features:

- 1. On-chain transactions for (up to) every observation block, and associated TLE prediction update.
- 2. On-chain stores of value (reputation, incentives, NFTs, etc.).
- 3. State-channel object storage (TLEs, algorithms, meta-data, etc.).


#### Decentralizing the System and its Governance

- Migrating to Ethereum Mainnet for decision democracy (e.g., for feature priority).
- Decentralized system for “tasking” the network (i.e., prioritizing satellites for observation).
- Decentralized governance of Proof of Satellite Engine upgrades.
- Decentralized moderation of general TruSat codebase.
- Community moderated “graduating” privileges of contributors.
- A system for distributing rewards/incentives to contributors (see next section).

#### Implementing On-Chain Incentives

In its initial releases, TruSat depends on participation (i.e., satellite observations) by individuals motivated by a concern for space sustainability and a desire to be a part of the solution; and individuals who enjoy the “sport” of spotting satellites.

- Relies on limited suite of Web2.0 mechanisms for enhancing the experience of sporting and sustainability-minded users (e.g., analytics and rankings, campaigns linked to sustainability objectives).
- Migrating to Ethereum Mainnet will enable TruSat to implement a fuller set of incentives for participation, including, potentially, distribution of value created by the network to its data contributors.
  - There has never been a tool quite like this, and ascertaining how it is used is part of the experiment. This will inform the universe of possibilities and design of incentive structures for future releases, including potentially a token model.
- Initial release is also dependent on the interests of the TruSat Partners in continuing to operate and develop this sustainability tool. Plan for release on Mainnet is to supply incentives for decentralized maintenance of this tool.
