TruSat was initially designed by ConsenSys Space.  With TruSatâ€™s founding Partners, the Secure World Foundation, Professor Moriba Jah, and the Society of Women in Space Exploration, ConsenSys Space released the first TruSat prototype on October 21, 2019 at the International Astronautical Congress.
