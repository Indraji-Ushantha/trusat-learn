## IV.TruSat Governance

Governance of TruSat in its initial, experimental phase divides into two broad dimensions: System governance, and governance of the open source Community that maintains and advances the TruSat System. Both dimensions will be governed by the TruSat Charter for during TruSat’s experimental phase.

The TruSat Charter is an agreement between the TruSat Partners—organizations committed to maintaining and advancing TruSat as a space sustainability tool—and delineates the Partners commitments and rolesin this regard. The Charter, which is available at [www.TruSat.org/Charter](https://trusat.org/charter), also governs how the broader community of open source contributors engages with the project. Each iteration of the Charter is time-limited to an “epoch,” after which it must be replaced according to the processes it specifies. Beyond the experimental phase, the Partners are committed to progressively decentralizing governance of TruSat by implementing blockchain-enabled governance tools.

At the System level, the primary governance matter is how the System is tasked (i.e., the selection of “Missions” prioritizing satellites for observation) to align System priorities with the needs of the space sustainability community. <small>1</small> During the experimental phase, the TruSat Partners will be responsible forfacilitating such taskings pursuant to a process specified in the Charter. The public availability of the Charter provides full transparency of the inner workings of the System during this experimental phase. As the System develops and matures, it is foreseeable that the community of satellite observers have a more direct role in setting System-wide priorities for observation.

The TruSat Charter will also specify governance arrangements for the TruSat Open Source Community, in a similar fashion to open source projects such as the OREKIT. <small>2</small> Among the matters that will be addressed are the open source licenses applicable to code and documentation contributions, processes for community input on feature roadmaps and priorities, and processes for reviewing and accepting code contributions.
